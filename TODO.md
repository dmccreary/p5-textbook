## p5.js 2.x Upgrade: MicroSim Fixes Needed (2026-09-05)

A static scan of this repo's `docs/sims/` MicroSims found **2 sim(s)** using p5.js v1-only APIs that will break if upgraded to p5.js 2.x (the microsim-generator skill's templates now default to p5@2.3.2). Fix these before bumping this repo's MicroSims past p5@1.x.

- [ ] **dev-environment-simulator** (`docs/sims/dev-environment-simulator/`)
    - `dev-environment-simulator.js` uses `preload()`, which p5.js v2 removed entirely — move the loading calls into `async function setup()` and `await` each `load*()` call before `createCanvas()`.
- [ ] **kinetic-typography-engine** (`docs/sims/kinetic-typography-engine/`)
    - `kinetic-typography-engine.js` uses `preload()`, which p5.js v2 removed entirely — move the loading calls into `async function setup()` and `await` each `load*()` call before `createCanvas()`.
